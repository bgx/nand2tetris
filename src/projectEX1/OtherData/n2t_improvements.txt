Improvement ideas that I wrote down at some time.  I don't know if they still apply, but I don't want to get rid of them.
***********************************
- get rid of getters and setters, they're not pythonic

-decouple processTerminal, updateSymbolTable, and writeIdentifierInfo

-Breakaway from project09 has a slow memory leak...it allocates about 20 new cells per new game.  it looks like I forgot to dispose String objects, but it could be something else

-Change when a character is cleared in Output, and possibly improve how characters are drawn

-Jack variable declarations on single line

-vmtranslator2 is kind of a mess

-complete implementation of VMCommandTranslator._translate() in vmtranslator2 to further reduce # of asm instructions generated
