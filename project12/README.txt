OPERATING SYSTEM

******************************

The Jack OS implementation is kept in the myOS folder.

Test each OS class in isolation.  To test a myOS class Xxx.Jack:
1) Place the Xxx.jack file into the XxxTest folder
2) Compile the XxxTest directory
3) Load the XxxTest's code into the VM emulator.  Yes, we will use the VM emulator's built-in implementations for any OS class that is not supplied.
4) Execute the code and check that the OS services are working properly

Batch files
