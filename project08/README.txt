vmtranslator.py is a Python script that will translate a *.vm virtual machine file into a *.asm assembly language file.

(vmtranslator.py in project08 folder translates stack arithmetic, memory access,
program flow, and function calling commands)

To run vmtranslator.py from a Windows command line, use the syntax:
<python.exe pathname> <vmtranslator.py pathname> <*.vm pathname -oR- folder pathname containing *.vm files>

RUN.bat is a batch file that will generate an *.asm file in each of the five project08 test folders:
(BasicLoop, Fibonacci, SimpleFunction, FibonacciElement, StaticsTest).

RUN.bat can be started from the command line by typing its pathname.
