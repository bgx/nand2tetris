The projects

project01 - Boolean Logic
    build elementary logic gates out of Nand gates

project02 - Boolean Arithmetic
    build ALU out of elementary logic gates

project03 - Sequential Logic
    build registers, memory banks, and counter chips 
    out of data-flip-flops

project04 - Machine Language
    Program in assembly language, get acquainted with
    Hack computer platform

project05 - Computer Architecture
    Integrate chips from projects 01-03 into a Hack 
    computer platform

project06 - Assembler
    Develop an assembler that translates Hack assembly
    language to binary code understood by 
    Hack computer platform
    
project07 - Virtual Machine I
    Write the first part of a VM-to-Hack translator,
    implementing stack arithmetic and memory access commands
    
project08 - Virtual Machine II
    Extend the VM-to-Hack translator from project07 into a 
    full-scale translator (with ability to handle program 
    flow and function calling commands)
    
project09 - High-Level Language
    Program in Jack, a simple object-based language, to 
    prepare for writing a Jack compiler and the Jack operating system
    
project10 - Compiler I
    Write the first part of a Jack compiler: a syntax analyzer
    that tokenizes the source and generates an XML parse tree
    
project11 - Compiler II
    Extend the syntax analyzer from project10 into a full-scale Jack
    compiler that generates executable VM code

project12 - Operating System
    Write a combination of a simple OS and a standard library for the
    Jack language, to (i) encapsulate various hardware-specific
    services in a software-friendly way, and (ii) extend Jack with 
    various functions and abstract data types
    
projectEX1 - Extra Project #1
    Take a program in high-level .jack, convert it to .hack binary 
    using my tools only (i.e. nothing author-supplied), and run on 
    the emulated Hack computer platform.
